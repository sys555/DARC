        "instruction": "You are a senior software engineer. You are asked to design a code repository sketch according to its README. This repository uses mainly the Python language.\nYour response should be a repository tree formatting like the output of linux `tree` command. However, your response should also include the reference relationship between the code files. To address this goal, you can add the import statements behind each file represented in the repository tree to reflect the possible reference relationships. You can separate the file name and the import statements with a `#` mark. For example, if the file`a.py` import the file `b.py` and `c.py`, you should present `a.py` in the repository tree as `a.py # import b; import c`. So a simple example repository tree can be:\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 a.py # import dir1.b; import dir1.c\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 dir1\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 b.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 c.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n```\nYou should design the repository sketch by observing the repository README, which will be give later.\n\n\n## Repository README\n```md\n# CVE-2023-44487\nBasic vulnerability scanning to see if web servers may be vulnerable to CVE-2023-44487\n\nThis tool checks to see if a website is vulnerable to CVE-2023-44487 completely non-invasively.\n\n1. The tool checks if a web server accepts HTTP/2 requests without downgrading them\n2. If the web server accepts and does not downgrade HTTP/2 requests the tool attempts to open a connection stream and subsequently reset it\n3. If the web server accepts the creation and resetting of a connection stream then the server is definitely vulnerable, if it only accepts HTTP/2 requests but the stream connection fails it may be vulnerable if the server-side capabilities are enabled.\n\nTo run,\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n    $ python3 cve202344487.py -i input_urls.txt -o output_results.csv\n\nYou can also specify an HTTP proxy to proxy all the requests through with the `--proxy` flag\n\n    $ python3 cve202344487.py -i input_urls.txt -o output_results.csv --proxy http://proxysite.com:1234\n\nThe script outputs a CSV file with the following columns\n\n- Timestamp: a timestamp of the request\n- Source Internal IP: The internal IP address of the host sending the HTTP requests\n- Source External IP: The external IP address of the host sending the HTTP requests\n- URL: The URL being scanned\n- Vulnerability Status: \"VULNERABLE\"/\"LIKELY\"/\"POSSIBLE\"/\"SAFE\"/\"ERROR\"\n- Error/Downgrade Version: The error or the version the HTTP server downgrades the request to\n\n*Note: \"Vulnerable\" in this context means that it is confirmed that an attacker can reset the a stream connection without issue, it does not take into account implementation-specific or volume-based detections*\n```",

        "output": "Based on the provided README for the CVE-2023-44487 repository, here is a structured repository tree that reflects the file organization and the relationships between the code files:\n\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cve202344487.py # import scanner; import utils; import csv; import argparse\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scanner.py # import http_client; import utils\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 http_client.py # import requests\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 utils.py # import datetime; import csv\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 input_urls.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 output_results.csv\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **cve202344487.py**: This is the main script that runs the vulnerability scan. It imports several modules: `scanner`, `utils`, and standard libraries like `csv` and `argparse`.\n- **scanner.py**: This module handles the scanning logic and imports `http_client` for making HTTP requests and `utils` for utility functions.\n- **http_client.py**: This module is responsible for making HTTP requests and imports the `requests` library for handling HTTP operations.\n- **utils.py**: This module contains utility functions, including handling timestamps and CSV operations. It imports `datetime` for date handling and `csv` for CSV file operations.\n- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python packages required for the project.\n- **input_urls.txt**: This file contains the list of URLs to be scanned.\n- **output_results.csv**: This file will store the results of the scans in CSV format.\n- **README.md**: This file provides an overview and instructions for using the repository. \n\nThis structure reflects a modular design, with clear responsibilities assigned to each file, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.",
