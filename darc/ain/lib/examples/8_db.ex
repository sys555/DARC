      "EasyLiterature" => "# EasyLiterature\n**EasyLiterature** is a Python-based command line tool for automatic literature management. Welcome star or contribute!\n\nSimply list the paper titles (or ids) you want to read in a markdown file and it will automatically `collect and refine its information in the markdown file`, `download the pdf to your local machine`, and `link the pdf to your paper in the markdown file`. You can forever keep your notes within the pdfs and mds on your local machine or cloud driver.\n\nInspired by [Mu Li](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nA41157y4), adapted from [autoLiterature](https://github.com/wilmerwang/autoLiterature). \nCompared to autoLiterature, **EasyLiterature** is much easier to use and supports a wider range of features, such as `title-based paper match`, `paper search and download on Google Scholar and DBLP` (the two main sites for scholars), `citation statistics`, `mannual information update assitant`, etc. **EasyLiterature covers almost all papers thanks to the support of Google Scholar and DBLP!**\n\n## A simple example\n1. Have the python installed on your local machine (preferably >= 3.7).\n2. Run `pip install easyliter` in your command line to install.\n3. Prepare your markdown note file (e.g., `Note.md`). <br>**Attention:** You may need to download a markdown editor to create/edit this file. I am using [Typora](https://typora.io/), which is not totally free. You can also choose other alternatives.\n4. List the formated papers titles in your markdown note file according to the Section 4 below (Recognition Rules). e.g.,<br>\n  \\- {{BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.}}<br>\n  \\- {{Xlnet: Generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding.}}<br>\n  **(pay attention to the space after \u2018\\-\u2019)** \n5. Create a folder to store the downloaded pdfs (e.g., `PDFs/`).\n6. Run `easyliter -i <path to your md file> -o <path to your pdf folder>`. \n<br> (Replace `<path to your md file>` with the actual path to your markdown note file, `<path to your pdf folder>` with the actual path to your pdf folder)\n<br>e.g., `easyliter -i \"/home/Note.md\" -o \"/home/PDFs\"`\n7. Your should able to see that the updated information and downloaded pdf files if no error is reported.\n8. This is a simple and common use case. For other features, please read the below sections carefully and follow the instructions.\n\n## Arguments\n```bash\neasyliter\n\noptional arguments:\n\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  \n  -i INPUT, --input INPUT\n  The path to the note file or note file folder.\n\n  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT\n  Folder path to save paper pdfs and images. NOTE: MUST BE FOLDER.\n\n  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY\n  The proxy. e.g. 127.0.0.1:1080. If this argument is specified, the google scholar will automatically use a free proxy (not necessarily using the specified proxy address). To use other proxies for google scholar, specify the -gp option. If you want to set up the proxies mannually, change the behaviour in GoogleScholar.set_proxy(). See more at https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ProxyGenerator.html.\n\n  -gp GPROXY_MODE, --gproxy_mode GPROXY_MODE\n  The proxy type used for scholarly. e.g., free, single, Scraper. (Note: 1. <free> will automatically choose a free proxy address to use, which is free, but may not be fast. 2. <single> will use the proxy address you specify. 3. <Scraper> is not free to use and need to buy the api key.).\n\n  -d, --delete\n  Delete unreferenced attachments in notes. Use with caution, when used, -i must be a folder path including all notes.\n\n  -m MIGRATION, --migration MIGRATION\n  The pdf folder path you want to reconnect to.\n```\n\n## Recognition Rules\n- If the notes file contains `- {paper_id}`, it will download the information of that literature, but not the PDF.\n- If the notes file contains `- {{paper_id}}`, it will download both the information of that literature and the PDF.\n\n- Note: `paper_id` supports `article title`, published articles' `doi`, and pre-published articles' `arvix_id`, `biorvix_id`, and `medrvix_id`. It will try all the possible sources online.\n\n## Usage\n### Basic Usage\nAssuming `input` is the folder path of the literature notes (.md files) and `output` is the folder path where you want to save the PDFs.\n\n```bash\n# Update all md files in the input folder\neasyliter -i input -o output \n\n# Only update the input/example.md file\neasyliter -i input/example.md -o output  \n\n# -d is an optional flag, when -i is a folder path, using -d will delete unrelated pdf files in the PDF folder from the literature notes content\neasyliter -i input -o output -d\n```\n\n### Migrating Notes and PDF Files\nWhen you need to move the literature notes or the PDF folder, the links to the PDFs in the literature notes might become unusable. You can use `-m` to re-link the PDF files with the literature notes.\n\n```bash\n# Update all md files in the input folder\neasyliter -i input -m movedPDFs/\n\n# Only update the input/example.md file\neasyliter -i input/example.md -m movedPDFs/  \n```",

This application allows you to measure and train this effect with a Polar H10 Heart Rate monitor.\n\nHeart rate variability, the small changes in heart rate from beat-to-beat, is a reliable measure of stress response. Heart rate variability reflects the balance between the two sides of the autonomic nervous system: the fight-or-flight response (from the sympathetic nervous system) and the rest-and-digest response (from the parasympathetic nervous system).\n\nIn any moment it is possible to restore balance to the autonomic nervous system by breathing slower and deeper. With every breath you take, you can set the pace of your breathing rate, measure your breathing control with the chest accelerometer, and see how heart rate variability responds.\n\n## Features\n\n- Connect and stream from a Polar H10, acceleration and heart rate data\n- Live breathing control feedback and adjustable pace setting\n- Track breathing and heart rate oscillations in real-time\n- Explore how heart rate vairability repsonses to different breathing rates\n\n## Installation and usage\n\nWorks with Polar H10, with Firmware Version 5.0.0 or later\n    \n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `my_project_env\\Scripts\\activate`\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    python EBYT.py \n\nBundle into an application with pyinstaller:\n\n    pyinstaller EBYT.spec\n\nThe program will automatically connect to your Polar device. For best breathing detection, ensure the Polar H10 is fitted around the widest part of the ribcage, stay seated and still while recording.\n\nSet the breathing pace with the slider (in breaths per minute), and follow the cadence as the gold circle expands and contracts. The blue circle shows your breathing control.\n\nTrack each breath cycle in the top graph, and how heart rate oscillates in repsonse.\n\nAdjust breathing pace and control to target the green zone of heart rate variability in the bottom graph (> 150 ms).",

It also gives the option to show the current settings and adjust them.\nAdjusting the settings can also be done directly by using the command `kanban configure`.\n\nUse `Ctrl-C` or `Ctrl-D` to exit the application at any time. :warning: If you exit in the middle of creating/updating a task,\nor changing settings, your progress wont be saved.\n\n### Automatic Task Creation\n  ```bash\n  kanban scan\n  ```\nAfter executing this command, kanban-python scans your current Directory recursively for the defined filetypes and searches for lines that start with the pattern provided.\n\nAfter confirmation to add the found tasks to table they will be added to the board. The alphanumeric Part of the Pattern will be used as tag.\nThe filepath were the task was found will be added as description of the task.\n\n### Create Report\n  ```bash\n  kanban report\n  ```\nGoes over all your Boards and creates a single markdown file by checking the `Completion Dates` of your tasks.\nAlso shows a nice github-like contribution table for the current year.\n\n### Change Settings\n  ```bash\n  kanban configure\n  ```\nTo create a new custom Columns, you have to edit the `pykanban.ini` manually and add a new column name + visibility status\nunder the `settings.columns.visible` section. The other options are all customizable now via the new settings menu.",
