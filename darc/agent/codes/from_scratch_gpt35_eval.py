Your response should be a repository tree formatting like the output of linux `tree` command. However, your response should also include the reference relationship between the code files. To address this goal, you can add the import statements behind each file represented in the repository tree to reflect the possible reference relationships. You can separate the file name and the import statements with a `#` mark. For example, if the file`a.py` import the file `b.py` and `c.py`, you should present `a.py` in the repository tree as `a.py # import b; import c`. So a simple example repository tree can be:
```
.
├── a.py # import dir1.b; import dir1.c
├── dir1
│   ├── b.py
